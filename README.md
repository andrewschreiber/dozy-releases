# Dozy Releases - GitHub Release Deployment System for Focusbase

**Automated deployment management via GitHub Releases** - A streamlined continuous deployment solution for [Focusbase.com](https://focusbase.com)

## Overview

Dozy Releases is a GitHub-based deployment automation repository that manages production releases for Focusbase. This system leverages GitHub's native release functionality to trigger and track deployments, providing version control, rollback capabilities, and deployment history.

## What is GitHub Release Deployment?

GitHub Release Deployment is a modern CI/CD pattern that uses GitHub's release feature to:
- **Version Control Deployments**: Track every production release with semantic versioning
- **Automate Deployment Pipelines**: Trigger automated builds and deployments on release creation
- **Enable Easy Rollbacks**: Quick rollback to previous stable versions
- **Maintain Deployment History**: Comprehensive changelog and deployment audit trail

## Features

### Deployment Automation
- ✅ Automated deployment triggering via GitHub releases
- ✅ Continuous deployment (CD) integration for Focusbase.com
- ✅ Release-based version management
- ✅ Deployment status tracking and monitoring

### Version Control & Release Management
- 📦 Semantic versioning support (e.g., v1.0.0, v1.1.0)
- 📝 Automated changelog generation
- 🏷️ Git tag-based release tracking
